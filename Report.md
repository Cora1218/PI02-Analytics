REPORT ON AIR CRASHES FROM AROUND THE WORLD

According to the graph of accidents per year, it can be seen that in 1946 there was the highest number of air accidents, 88, of which there were 1,349 deaths. 

Some possible reasons could be:

Expansion of commercial aviation: After World War II, there was significant growth in the commercial aviation industry. The increase in the number of flights and airlines could have contributed to an increased risk of accidents.

Developing technology and regulations: At the time, aviation safety technology and regulations were constantly developing. It is possible that some technological advances were not yet fully established, which may have influenced flight safety.

Reconstruction after the war: After the war, many aviation-related infrastructures and services were being rebuilt. This could have led to certain deficiencies in terms of aircraft maintenance, crew training and safety management systems.

Human factors: Human errors may also have contributed to a higher number of accidents. This includes errors by pilots, air traffic controllers and other aviation professionals.

In the graph of the mortality rate per year, it is observed that in the years 1909, 1912 and 1924 the mortality rate was 100%, that is to say, all those on board lost their lives.
